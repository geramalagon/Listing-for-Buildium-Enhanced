Gets your buildium property listings and display them in an interactive way instead of using iframe and gives you styling and SEO freedom.

== Description ==

“Listings for Buildium” is a simple light-weight property listing plugin that allows you to list your rental properties on your WordPress site from your Buildium account using a shortcode.

The old iframe method of showing buildium rental listings does not allow site owners to customize the styling and improve SEO. This plugin will give you freedom to make any changes to the listings page.
All your buildium rental listings will be shown in an interactive way which you can customize using CSS easily. You will get all the filters from your buildium listings page working as they work there.

Shortcode: **[bldm_listings]**
where you want to show the rental listings. A full-width page is recommended for good styling.

Notice: This plugin depends on "allow_url_fopen" to get the content from buildium rental listings site. Please add "allow_url_fopen = 1" in your php.ini file or contact your hosting to enable it.

You will need to enter your buildium account page URL in the plugin settings that looks like this - https://example.managebuilding.com
(Please don't include trailing slash at the end)
